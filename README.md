An Adapt Framework clone build with React

At work we use the Adapt Framework to build our training content. I love the flexibility of the framework and after developing a few components, it got me thinking of what it would look like if built in React.

## Running the Example

- Pull the repository
- run npm install
- run npm run start
- navigate to localhost:9000
- enjoy!
